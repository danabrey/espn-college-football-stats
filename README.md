# ESPN College Football Stats

Object-oriented PHP package for reading data from the ESPN JSON API.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/danabrey/espn-college-football-stats.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/danabrey/espn-college-football-stats)

## Installation

Via Composer:

`composer require danabrey/espn-college-football-stats`

## Usage

Scrape a player's stats by passing their ESPN player ID (found in the URL e.g. `https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/player/stats/_/id/4241463/jerry-jeudy`)

```$php
$stats = new DanAbrey\ESPNCollegeFootballStats\ESPNCollegeFootballStats();
$playerStats = $stats->getPlayer(4241463);
```

The return from `getPlayer()` will be a `Player` object, which includes their ID and a `seasons` property which is an array of `PlayerSeason` objects, containing the stats for the player that season.

### Team Stats

Fetching stats for teams is similar.

The return from `getTeam()` will be a `Team` object, which includes their ID and a `seasons` property which is an array of `TeamSeason` objects.

```php
$stats = new DanAbrey\ESPNCollegeFootballStats\ESPNCollegeFootballStats();
$teamStats = $stats->getTeam(333);
```

By default, it will return the last four seasons' worth of data. You can change this by passing an array of seasons to `$stats->setSeasons()`.

```php
$stats = new DanAbrey\ESPNCollegeFootballStats\ESPNCollegeFootballStats();
$stats->setTeamSeasons([2015, 2016]);
$teamStats = $stats->getTeam(333);
```

## Disclaimer

This package is intended as a proof of concept experiment, I highly advise against using the ESPN API (which isn't documented) for anything other than hobby personal use.
